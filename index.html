                <p>I've been programming for about 10 years. My father worked in technology, 
                    so I followed his footsteps and learned programming myself. Over the years 
                    I have learned HTML, Javascript, CSS, Java, and many other programming languages. 
                    Outside of programming, I also enjoy juggling. It's been a hobby of mine since 
                    I was a kid, and I enjoy it a lot!
