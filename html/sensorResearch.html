                <h3>Pixel 8 Pro Temperature Sensor - The Verge</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a Verge article about a new temperature sensor on the Google Pixel 8 Pro. I found that<br />
                    while the information about this fature was really cool, it's probably not super useful within<br />
                    the scope of what I'm doing for this project. First off, since this is still a relatively new <br />
                    feature, I wouldn't necessarily want to develop an app using this because it's not on a lot of phones. <br />
                    Also, judging by the article, it's not super reliable quite yet. <br /><br />

                <h3>Sensors Overview - Android Developers</h3>
                <p>
                    This resource will likely prove far more useful. It's official documentation from Google about the<br />
                    sensors on Android phones and how to make use of them in your development work. It provides a very<br />
                    comprehensive list of all the sensors, what the sensors do, and how to use them in your programming.<br /><br />

                <h3>All the Sensors in Your Smartphone and How They Work - Gizmodo</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a Gizmodo article giving a rough overview of how all the sensors work in your phone. This will <br />
                    probably be the first article I really dive into, so that I have a rough overview of how these sensors <br />
                    work before I dive into the official documentation so that I'm not completely flustered by all the <br />
                    information there. While it'll definitely make good surface level research, I don't think it'll be <br />
                    something I reference when I make my deep dive into programming one of these sensors, so that's the only <br />
                    thing stopping me from giving this a higher score<br /><br />

                <h3>Android - Sensors - TutorialsPoint</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a resourse that provides tutorials for how to program various Android Sensors. I feel like this <br />
                    prove to be more useful than the official documentation, since past experiences have proven that checking <br />
                    the official documentation when I'm just starting out can prove a bit confusing, since most places assume <br />
                    you have a fair amount of knowledge in the subject already. This presents the information in a much more <br />
                    beginner friendly way, so I'll absolutely check this one a lot when I'm starting out.<br /><br />

                <h3>w3schools</h3>
                <p>
                    Last, but certainly not least, is w3schools. Ever since I started programming I've used this, and while it might <br />
                    not have anything directly relating to sensors, it certainly includes a lot of resources relating to concepts <br />
                    like HTML, JavaScript, React, Kotlin, Node.js, and other tools that we'll be using in this class. So it's definitely <br />
                    going to be a resource I use a lot this quarter<br /><br />
